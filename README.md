# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test code, but you
can base yours on test code from other exercises.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not? Add your answer, including your
reasoning, to this markdown file.

The run times for the fibonnacci sequence will be different. Since the normal fibonnaci recursion
is splitting in two for each recursion call it has a run time of O(2<sup>n</sup>), while 
the tail recursion has a complexity of O(n) because it does the fun in the call meaning
that it only does the sum n times.
